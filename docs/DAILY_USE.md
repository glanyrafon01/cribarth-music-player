# Daily Use

Once the address is saved, the app opens Music Assistant directly.

## Playing music

1) Open the app.
2) Use the Music Assistant interface just like you would in a browser.
3) Choose "This Device" as the player if needed.

## Changing the saved address

If you move your Music Assistant to a new address, the app needs to be reset.

1) Close the app.
2) Find and delete the `config.json` file in your user data folder.
3) Open the app again and enter the new address.

If you need help locating that folder, ask and I can add a simple reset option to the app.
