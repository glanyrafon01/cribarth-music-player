# First Run Setup

When you open the app for the first time, it asks for the web address of your Music Assistant instance.

## Finding your Music Assistant address

Use the same address you would type into a web browser to open Music Assistant, for example:

- `http://192.168.1.100:8123/d5369777_music_assistant/ingress`

## Entering the address

1) Paste or type the address into the field.
2) Select "Save and Continue".

The app will remember this address for next time.
