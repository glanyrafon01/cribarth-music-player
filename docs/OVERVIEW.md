# Cribarth Music Player Overview

Cribarth Music Player is a small desktop app that opens the Music Assistant web player in its own window. It keeps the player separate from your browser so you can leave it running, switch tracks, and pick "This Device" from the Music Assistant player list.

## What the app does

- Opens a dedicated window for your Music Assistant instance.
- Remembers the web address you enter on first run.
- Starts quickly the next time because it already knows where to go.

## What the app does not do

- It does not store music or playlists on your computer.
- It does not replace Music Assistant or Home Assistant.
- It does not add extra controls beyond what Music Assistant already provides.
