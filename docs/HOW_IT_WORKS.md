# How the App Works

This app is a simple window for your Music Assistant website. It does not run the music server itself.

## Startup flow

1) The app checks if it already knows your Music Assistant address.
2) If it does, it opens that address in a desktop window.
3) If it does not, it shows a setup screen and asks for the address.

## What is stored

- Only the address you entered is saved so the app knows where to open.
- The address is stored on your computer in a small settings file.

## What stays online

- Music playback and your library remain in Music Assistant.
- The app just displays that existing web interface.
